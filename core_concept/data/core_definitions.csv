Multi-platformed examples do occur, however (Cooper 1943:Figs. 9-11). They are characterised by a series of stacked step-fractures around the perimeter of the platform that often deeply undercut the distal sections of the core. In use the platform serves as the base of the tool and the step-flaked margin forms a a steep-edged chopping and planing tool. Flenniken and White (1985:135) suggest that horsehoof cores are in fact normal producer cores showing platform preparation. I have, I think demonstrated that they are tools in their own right and that the process of deliberately creating step-fractures was an edge resharpening method that reduced gross weight loss and conserved the mass of the material (Akerman 1993:125-127).""","Akerman, K. 1993 The status of the horsehoof core.

They were separated visually from the other tools and to them were added a group of implements similar in many respects but which lacked step-retouch on the edges. The group now corresponded to Mulvaney's core scrapers (Mulvaney and Joyce, 1965, p. 176).

Utilized edges on these tools range from 69° to 129° a result obtained by using a template former to make an edge profile, making it possible to measure the actual working edge without obstruction from projecting faces. This is important because a major characteristic of edges on these implements is that acute as well as obtuse angled edges become overhanging above the working edge. This is especially the case with step-retouched edges. It is interesting to note that many obtuse angled edges were not retouched. This overhanging of the edge is coupled with a considerable height-always at least as high as the width of the base and often up to twice this distance. Since all horsehoofs and core scrapers will balance on this base the face above the working edge might appropriately be described as 'cliffed'.

Working edges on cliffed scrapers have son1e other characteristics. Use-fracturing is unifacial or mainly unifacial directed from the base or platform up the overhanging face. Scalar and step retouch is always unifacial and is similarly directed, tending to increase the cliffed appearance. Amongst the scrapers step-retouching is confined to cliffed scrapers. Step retouch directed up the face of the tool is clearly different from the facetting on prepared platform cores, and from that on some tula adze flakes on which the step retouch runs from the face of the flake across the striking platform.""","McCarthy, F.D. 1967 Australian Aboriginal stone implements: including bone, shell and tooth implements.

On the surface of it this appears to be a contradictory statement: how can a flake be a core? Hiscock, for instance, would include such items in his retouched category. I considered this possibility but decided against it for the following reason. While it is true that both burin and tranchet cores are retouched flakes, conjoin analysis has demonstrated that the express purpose of flakes of these sorts is to use to manufacture flakes of appropriate shape for blade manufacture (Witter in prep; Hiscock, 1985 and in prep). Both are also highly distinctive in form, and can be easily recognised.

I decided, therefore, that as they were cores in this sense, and because other retouched flakes could not be mistaken for them, that it was acceptable to categorise them in this way.""","Hiscock, P. 1985 The need for a taphonomic perspective in stone artefact analysis.

PhD, Sydney, University of Sydney.",thesis_phd,1978,26-29,bipolar core,yes,subcategory,"""A careful microscopic examination of experimental bipolar cores which represented the stone materials used in the tool-use experiments, revealed a series of damage attributes that can appear singularly or in combination on bipolar cores and some of the fragments struck off these cores. The first three categories replace the vague descriptions 'shattered', 'bruised', 'battered' and 'splintered' which are currently used in the various definitions of bipolar cores and which have led to the mis identification of a small number of utilised flakes, retouched flakes, weathered stone fragments and other odd fragments of stone as 'fabricators' or scalar cores (Kamminga 1971:33-34, 132-137).

1. PERCUSSION RIDGE
Equivalent to 'ridge of percussion', Binford and Quimby 1963:356, and 'central ridge' Kamminga 1971:31 (see plates 11-14, 17).

The percussion ridge may be straight (plate 14), wavy (plate 11) or more often curved (plates 13,17; viz. the 'wedge' or gouge like end of some 'fabricators'; Campbell and Noone 1943:297; McCarthy, Bramell and Noone 1946:34; 1967:36). Points or areas of crushing can occur on the prominences of these ridges. Fracture types on the margins are predominantly a complex combination of step and to a lesser extent hinge, and retroflexed hinge, although there may also be some feather fractures...

2. PERCUSSION STUB
Equivalent to 'point of percussion' (Binford and Quimby 1963:356) and 'stub end' (Kamminga 1971:31) (see plate 18).

The end of the bipolar core can be stub-like or generally squarish. This percussion stub is usually characterised by severe internal fracturing, which is quite noticeable on translucent materials, like quartz or obsidian, where the small internal fractures act as reflectors, making the ends appear 'milky'. The stub, and its margins if they can be defined, are usually heavy step (often overlapping or layered; see plate 18) retroflexed hinge, hinge and feather fractured...

3. PERCUSSION PLATFORM Equivalent to'area of percussion'
(Binford and Quimby 1963:356) also described in Kamminga 1971:24).

The percussion platform is either the remnant of the original upper striking platform of the core or flake being reduced, or more often the remnant of the lower platform that rested on the anvil. Sometimes complete hertzian cones can be seen on the platforms, near edges, but only if the materials are fine-textured silicates. The hertzian cones result from direct hammer blows that struck too far back from the edges to initiate a large crack (see Kamminga 1971:fig. 5). Fractures along the edges of the platforms can be step, retroflexed hinge, hinge and feather.

4. LATERAL SURFACE FRACTURING (Kamminga 1971:31)
Flake scars initiated from the percussion ridges, stubs or platforms occur on at least one lateral surface of the bipolar core. These fractures may be step, retroflexed hinge, hinge and feather, and they can extend to as far as the opposite end of the core. The waviness that cometimes characterises a percussion ridge is mostly caused by the alternate detachment of these large flakes. Probably the most important damage features on bipolar cores of fine-textured silicates are:

1. The appearance of percussion ridges and stubs.
2. The high frequency of step, retroflexed hinge and hinge fractures.
3. Internal cracking and undetached flakes.
4. The angle and positioning of the fractures along the margins of stubs and ridges.
5. Points and areas of intense crushing.

All these features are consistent with a traumatic 90° impact with a hard hammer. Initially striking an acute edge with a heavy hammerstone causes a fragile or sharp edge to shatter. After this severe fracturing, which can include snap (bending) fractures, the edge is much wider and has an irregular profile. This can also be characteristic of the edge of the core (which may be a large flake) sitting on the anvil. With a further blow, fracture initiation occurs at a number of sites and one or more of the fractures propagating from these sites are dominant, terminating at the free surfaces as step and hinge fractures. Other cracks or fractures terminate in the interior of the core and remain as flaws, sometimes being reinitiated with subsequent hammer blows, or else weakening the area below the surface, encouraging the development of areas of crushing and overlapping scars.","Binford, L.R. and G.I.

The great weight of the large examples greatly increased their effectiveness in wood working. Most of the periphery of the base is trimmed to provide a working-edge. The sides and the crest (apex) are roughly shaped by flaking. The angle formed by the sides with the base was initially relatively acute, but with resharpening, it became progressively less so and ultimately obtuse, until in some examples the walls actually overhang the base.

This core type is derived from a split cobble or a blocky piece of stone, usually silcrete or an igneous rock that has one or more naturally flat surfaces. These faces served as striking platforms for flake detachment. When on flat surface became exhausted by repeated detachments, increasingly failed ones, the core was rotated and another flat surface struck by a hammer, until it was also spent. As flakes were struck progressively around the periphery of the cobble or block, the core became wider towards its base.

They are found on camp sites in association with the semi-uniface pebble chopper and an occasional 'Sumatra type,' but not with flakes or blades. The working edge of the 'horsehoof' is formed, here and there, by step or check flaking which is evidently not due to maladroitness in an attempt to produce a flake or to defects in the material, but is intentional.

The procedure is to set the core on the anvil so as to obtain direct contact when struck by the hammerstone. If the material is tough it may take numerous blows to develop a stress line for fracture. In the course of this, small retouch flakes are produced at both ends until the core splits in two.
